# Introduction to Java Programming  
**Date:** 14.03.2025  
**Time:** 10:30 - 12:30  

## 1. Objectives  
- Understanding the Basics of Java and Object-Oriented Programming  
- Printing a Value to the Command-Line  
- Using Command-Line Arguments  
- Understanding Classes, Objects, and Methods  

## 2. Theory/Concepts  
- Understanding the Basic Syntax of Java  
- Defining and Using Variables  
- Using `System.out.print()` to print a value to the screen and `System.out.println()` to print a value and add a newline  
- What is a Class and How to Create a Class  

## 3. Algorithm / Flowchart  
*(To be added)*  

## 4. Source Code

## 5. Sample Input & Expected Output  
*(To be added)*  

## 6. Observations  
- Used Command-Line Argument: `javac MyFirstProgram` but encountered an error:  
  ```
  error: Class names, 'MyFirstProgram', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested
  1 error
  ```
- Instead, used: `javac MyFirstProgram.java`, which compiled successfully.  

## 7. Conclusion  
- We used `println` statements to print text to the display. `print` does not add a newline at the end, while `println` does.  
- We created our first class, `Student`.
